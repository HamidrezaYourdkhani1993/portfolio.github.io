TECHNOLOGIES AND TOOLS USED 

Throughout the development of my personal portfolio website, I utilized a variety of technologies and tools to create a functional and engaging online platform. These tools allowed me to implement dynamic features, ensure responsiveness, and optimize the user experience. The key technologies and tools employed in this project include: 

 

HTML: The foundation of the website's structure and content, HTML provided the markup for organizing elements and information. 

CSS: Cascading Style Sheets were used to design the layout, typography, and visual aspects of the website, ensuring a visually appealing presentation. 

JavaScript: Leveraging JavaScript enhanced the website's interactivity, allowing for dynamic content updates and smooth animations. 

jQuery 3.3.1: The jQuery library was utilized to simplify JavaScript code and expedite the implementation of interactive features. 

PHP: PHP scripting was employed to establish a connection with the MySQL database and enable server-side functionality. 

MySQL Database: The MySQL database stored user inquiries and messages, ensuring secure data management and retrieval. 

SMTP for Email Sending: The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol was used to facilitate email communication by sending user messages to a designated email address. 

Font Awesome Library: The Font Awesome library provided a collection of icons that enriched the visual appeal and user engagement of the website. 

Bootstrap Utilities: Bootstrap's utility classes were used to streamline the styling process, creating responsive layouts and consistent designs. 

Single HTML File for SPA: The single HTML file approach allowed for the creation of a Single Page Application (SPA), reducing page reloads and enhancing user experience.
